This project aims to develop a dynamic and efficient Inventory Management System using Java. It will 
utilize AWT and Swing for an interactive user interface, integrate txt Files for robust database 
management, and leverage Window Builder within Eclipse for seamless development. The system will 
help businesses track stock levels, sales, and supplies efficiently while maintaining accurate inventory 
records.
